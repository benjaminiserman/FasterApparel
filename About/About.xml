	<description>Are your pawns taking too long to change into their battle armor? Then this is the mod for you! This mod lowers the time neccessary to don and doff all apparel (including apparel added by other mods!) by 3x. This factor can be changed in mod settings.
	
This was a request from Xx_H3tTi_xX on Ludeon Forums.
	
Faster Apparel should be compatible with everything, including multiplayer and Combat Extended. If you find an issue, feel free to report it in the comments below. Note: For multiplayer compatibility, make sure all players have the same mod settings.
